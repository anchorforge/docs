## Intergration quickstart - step by step 

The technical effort required for integration depends on your stack and typically ranges from a few hours to a few days.

### Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
<Step title="Create an Anchor Account">

Visit [Anchor UI](https://app.anchorbrowser.io/api-key) and ensure you have an active Anchor account.

</Step>
<Step title="Automatically create a browser-creation key per each user">

Like authentication or billing services, each user in your system should have a dedicated browser-creation key.

Use our [API reference](http://docs.anchorbrowser.io/api-reference/api-keys/create-api-key) to generate a key for each existing and new user.

<Note> You can limit the number of concurrent browsers per user using the `max_concurrent_browsers` property in the `Create API Key` endpoint</Note>
</Step>
<Step title="Expose a New API Endpoint">
 
Implement a new API endpoint in your service that will call the [Create Session API](http://docs.anchorbrowser.io/api-reference/sessions/create-session). Through this endpoint you can allow your customers to specify any HTTPS proxy string, allowing you to preserve configuration capabilities which are based on the proxy connection string values.

</Step>
<Step title="(Optional) DNS Configuration">

For a seamless white-label experience, configure a CNAME record in your DNS to point a subdomain (e.g., `browsers.yourdomain.com`) to `connect.anchorbrowser.io`. This ensures browser traffic routes through your domain.

<Note> Completing this step ensures no usage of Anchor Browser domains is required from your end users. </Note>

</Step>
<Step title="Expose the New Service to Customers">

Update your documentation and/or UI to guide users on creating a new browser and establishing a CDP connection. You can adapt sections of the Anchor Browser User Quickstart Guide for your documentation.

</Step>
<Step title="Advanced - Provide live browser view to customers">

Offer your customers a live view of the proxied browser session by embedding or linking to the following URL:

```
https://anchorforge.io/devtools-frontend/inspector.html?wss=wss://browsers.yourdomain.com?apiKey={End-User-Key}&sessionId={Session-Id}
```

You can also self-host this component and serve it as your own asset.
