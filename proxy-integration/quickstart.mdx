## Introduction

As automation, AI, and web scraping continue to evolve, browser-based automation is becoming increasingly vital. End customers are demanding simple, efficient ways to automate workflows that mimic human behavior. The most effective approach combines the power of a robust proxy solution with an anti-detect, secure, and scalable headless browser.

Anchor Browser is the only headless browser provider offering an OEM model tailored for proxy vendors, enabling you to deliver a seamless, white-labeled automation experience to your customers.

## Why add Headless browser to my proxy solution

By integrating Anchor Browser into your product line, you empower your customers to perform browser-based automations with unprecedented simplicity, success rates, and durability.

### Out-of-the-Box Features with Anchor Browser

Unlike traditional automation scripts or locally run automated browsers, Anchor Browser provides the following advanced features:

- **Stealth Mode**: Mimics human behavior to avoid detection.
- **Ad Blocking**: Accelerates page load times and minimizes variability in automation steps.
- **Automated CAPTCHA Solving**: Effortlessly bypass CAPTCHAs, including Cloudflare CAPTCHA.
- **Infinite Scalability**: Scale up operations without technical limitations.

## Choosing a cost structure for your end-users

You can choose from two common cost structures for end-user access to the browser feature:

1. **Increased Proxy GB Cost**: Adjust the baseline proxy pricing to include the browser functionality.
2. **Flat Cost per Concurrent Browser**: Offer users a set number of concurrent browser sessions without usage-based pricing.

Both options are straightforward to implement by following the guide below.

## Intergration quickstart - step by step 

The technical effort required for integration depends on your stack and typically ranges from a few hours to a few days.

### Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
<Step title="Create an Anchor Account">

Visit [Anchor UI](https://app.anchorbrowser.io/api-key) and ensure you have an active Anchor account.

</Step>
<Step title="Automatically create a browser-creation key per each user">

Like authentication or billing services, each user in your system should have a dedicated browser-creation key.

Use our [API reference](http://docs.anchorbrowser.io/api-reference/api-keys/create-api-key) to generate a key for each existing and new user.

<Note> You can limit the number of concurrent browsers per user using the `max_concurrent_browsers` property in the `Create API Key` endpoint</Note>
</Step>
<Step title="Expose a New API Endpoint">
 
Implement a new API endpoint in your service to wrap the [Create Session API](http://docs.anchorbrowser.io/api-reference/sessions/create-session). Through this endpoint you can allow your customers to specify any HTTPS proxy string, allowing you to preserve configuration capabilities which are based on the proxy connection string values.

</Step>
<Step title="(Optional) DNS Configuration">

For a seamless white-label experience, configure a CNAME record in your DNS to point a subdomain (e.g., `browsers.yourdomain.com`) to `connect.anchorbrowser.io`. This ensures browser traffic routes through your domain.

<Note> Completing this step ensures no usage of Anchor Browser domains is required from your end users. </Note>

</Step>
<Step title="Expose the New Service to Customers">

Update your documentation and/or UI to guide users on creating a new browser and establishing a CDP connection. You can adapt sections of the Anchor Browser User Quickstart Guide for your documentation.

</Step>
<Step title="Advanced - Provide live browser view to customers">

Offer your customers a live view of the proxied browser session by embedding or linking to the following URL:

```
https://niftik.github.io/dtfe/inspector.html?wss=browsers.yourdomain.com?apiKey={End-User-Key}&sessionId={Session-Id}
```

You can also self-host this component and serve it as your own asset.
