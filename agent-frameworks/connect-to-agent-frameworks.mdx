Anchor Browser seamlessly integrates with a variety of AI agent frameworks, enabling agents to leverage browser sessions to accomplish complex tasks on the web. These frameworks include Langchain, CrewAI, and others, providing various ways to automate workflows, interact with web content, and execute specific web tasks.

## Integration Methods Overview

You can integrate Anchor Browser with your AI agent in several ways, depending on your use case. Whether you need flexibility in browsing or defined workflows, Anchor Browser can accommodate different levels of automation, all while keeping your agents secure.

### Integration Options

- **Flexible Browser Tool**: The AI agent can use Anchor Browser as a general-purpose browsing tool, allowing it to freely explore and interact with web pages based on dynamic instructions. This is ideal for use cases that require exploration or searches across multiple domains.
- **Specific-Flow Tools Defined in the Agent Framework**: Create tools within your agent platform (like Langchain or CrewAI) using Anchor Browser, tailored to a particular workflow. These tools allow for efficient automation of common tasks by predefining steps that can be reused whenever required.
- **Specific-Flow Tools Defined in Anchor Browser**: Define specific tools directly in the Anchor platform, which can be integrated into your AI agent workflow using built-in API connectors. This option allows your agents to utilize predefined, reusable tools without additional development.
