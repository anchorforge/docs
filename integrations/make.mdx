## About Make

Make (from Make.com) is a no-code automation platform that lets you connect apps and services together to build powerful workflows â€” without writing code.

You can think of it like a visual programming tool:

- You pick modules (like Gmail, Slack, or your own API)
- Set up triggers and actions
- And let Make automatically move data and perform tasks across tools

The modules are represented by circles in different colors. They are connected by dotted lines. We can see how one event triggers 3 different tasks.

## Quick Start
Use our modules to enhance your automation workflows with Anchor Browser powerful tools.

<Warning>
  Currently, our modules are not publicly available in the Make. (We are working on it!) You are welcome to contact us to get the public link.

### Module Selection

Use our ai-task-completion module as a master tool that can be used to perform various tasks in a single module.

### Basic Workflow

Here is a basic workflow that uses our modules to perform a task, capture a screenshot and save it to a file both in google drive and slack.
