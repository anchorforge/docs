## Overview

Anchor provides Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, allowing you to use browser automation directly by your preferred agent. This enables seamless browser control from Cursor, VS Code, Claude, ChatGPT, and other MCP-compatible tools.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that allows AI assistants to interact with external tools and data sources.

In our case, it enables AI-powered tools to access and control our browser automation capabilities directly within your IDE or agent apps.


<Expandable title="Setup in Cursor">
## Setup in cursor
Other MCP-compatible tools follow about the same pattern.

The MCP server runs on our servers (https://api.anchorbrowser.io/mcp), and is available to all users providing their Anchor API Key.
### Configure MCP in Cursor

Alternatively, edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file directly.


<Steps>
<Step title="Open Command Palette">
Press Command+Shift+P (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+P (Linux/Windows) and select "Open MCP Configuration File"
<img src="/images/mcp-get-settings.png" alt="Get Cursor MCP Settings" />
</Step>
<Step title="Open MCP Configurations">
Click on "Add Custom MCP" or "New MCP Server" if you already have some preconfigured.
<img src="/images/mcp-add-custom.png" alt="Add Custom MCP Server" />
</Step>
<Step title="Add MCP Server">
Add inside the `mcpServers` object the following:

```json
"Anchor Browser Agent": {
    "url": "https://api.anchorbrowser.io/mcp",
    "headers": {
    "anchor-api-key": "YOUR_ANCHOR_API_KEY"
    }
}
```
<Info>
  If you don't have your Anchor API key yet, you can get it from [Anchor UI](https://app.anchorbrowser.io/api-key).
</Info>

You should now see Anchor MCP server in the list of MCP servers in Cursor. It should say '24 tools enabled'. If you don't see it, disable and re-enable Anchor MCP server, or wait a little longer.
That's it! You can now use Anchor directly in your conversations with Cursor's AI assistant.

# Usage

Once configured, you can use Anchor Browser directly in your conversations with Cursor's AI assistant.
Currently, Cursor needs you to actively approve its steps.

## Available Commands

The MCP integration provides access to most main Anchor capabilities:

Of course they can be reached using free language, as shown in the examples below.

### Test Generator Example
```
- You are a playwright test generator.
- You are given a scenario and you need to generate a playwright test for it.
- DO NOT generate test code based on the scenario alone. 
- DO run steps one by one using the tools provided by the Anchor Browser Agent MCP.
- Only after all steps are completed, emit a Playwright TypeScript test that uses @playwright/test based on message history
- Save generated test file in the tests directory
- Execute the test file and iterate until the test passes
Generate a Playwright test for the following scenario:
1. Navigate to https://www.imdb.com/
2. search for 'Garfield'
3. return  the director of the last movie
```
<video   autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsInline src="/images/garfield-test-generator.mp4" alt="Test Generator" />
<Expandable title="garfield-test.spec.ts File">
That is the generated test file:
```js
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
test('Find director of the last Garfield movie', async ({ page }) => {
  // Step 1: Navigate to IMDB
  await page.goto('https://www.imdb.com/');
  
  // Verify we're on the IMDB homepage
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/IMDb/);
  
  // Step 2: Search for 'Garfield'
  // Click on the search box
  await page.getByTestId('suggestion-search').click();
  
  // Type 'Garfield' into the search box
  await page.getByTestId('suggestion-search').fill('Garfield');
  
  // Submit the search
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit search' }).click();
  
  // Verify we're on the search results page
  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/\/find\/\?q=Garfield/);
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Find - IMDb/);
  
  // Step 3: Click on the most recent Garfield movie (The Garfield Movie 2024)
  await page.getByRole('link', { name: 'The Garfield Movie' }).click();
  
  // Verify we're on the movie page
  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/\/title\/tt5779228/);
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/The Garfield Movie \(2024\)/);
  
  // Step 4: Extract the director information
  // The director information is displayed in the main content area
  const directorElement = page.locator('text=Director').locator('..').locator('a').first();
  
  // Verify the director is Mark Dindal
  await expect(directorElement).toHaveText('Mark Dindal');
  
  // Log the director name for verification
  const directorName = await directorElement.textContent();
  console.log(`Director of The Garfield Movie (2024): ${directorName}`);
  
  // Assert the expected result
  expect(directorName).toBe('Mark Dindal');
});
```
