# What is Playwright?

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is Microsoft's modern browser automation framework that enables reliable end-to-end testing and web scraping across all major browsers (Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit). It provides a unified API for controlling browsers programmatically, making it the industry standard for automated browser interactions.

## Why Playwright + Anchor Browser?

Anchor Browser leverages Playwright's robust browser automation capabilities to provide enterprise-grade reliability and cross-browser compatibility. While Playwright handles the low-level browser control, Anchor Browser adds:

- Cloud-hosted browser instances - No local browser management required
- AI-powered interactions - Natural language task execution beyond traditional scripting
- Enterprise security - Isolated environments with authentication and proxy support
- Self-healing automations - Built-in error recovery and adaptation to website changes

### Key Playwright Capabilities

- Multi-Browser Support - Test across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari with identical code
- Fast & Reliable - Auto-wait for elements, built-in retry logic, and parallel execution
- Powerful Debugging - Time-travel debugging, trace viewer, and UI mode for visual testing
- Visual Testing - Automated screenshot comparison and visual regression detection
- Precise Element Selection - Advanced locators for reliable element targeting


### How It Works with Anchor Browser

When you connect to Anchor Browser, you're using Playwright's familiar API but with cloud-hosted browsers:

```javascript node.js
import { chromium } from 'playwright';
import AnchorClient from 'anchorbrowser';

const anchorClient = new AnchorClient({
  apiKey: process.env.ANCHOR_API_KEY,
});

// First create a session
const session = await anchorClient.sessions.create();
const cdp_url = session.data.cdp_url;

// Then connect using the session's CDP URL
const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(cdp_url);
console.log('Browser connected');

browser.close();
```

This gives you all of Playwright's power while eliminating infrastructure complexity and adding enterprise features.
