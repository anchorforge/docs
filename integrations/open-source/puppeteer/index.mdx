# What is Puppeteer?

[Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) is Google's Node.js library for controlling headless Chrome or Chromium browsers via the DevTools Protocol. It provides a high-level API for browser automation, making it one of the most widely adopted tools for web scraping, testing, and automated interactions.

## Why Puppeteer + Anchor Browser?

Anchor Browser leverages Puppeteer's mature CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) integration to provide seamless cloud browser automation. While Puppeteer handles the low-level browser control, Anchor Browser adds:

- Cloud-hosted browser instances - No local browser management required
- AI-powered interactions - Natural language task execution beyond traditional scripting
- Enterprise security - Isolated environments with authentication and proxy support
- Self-healing automations - Built-in error recovery and adaptation to website changes

### Key Puppeteer Capabilities

- CDP Native - Direct Chrome DevTools Protocol integration for precise browser control
- Lightweight & Fast - Minimal overhead with direct browser communication
- Extensive Ecosystem - Rich plugin ecosystem and community support
- Network Interception - Capture and modify network requests and responses
- PDF Generation - Convert web pages to PDFs with full rendering support

### How It Works with Anchor Browser

When you connect to Anchor Browser, you're using Puppeteer's familiar API but with cloud-hosted browsers:

```javascript node.js
import AnchorClient from 'anchorbrowser';
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer-core';

const anchorClient = new AnchorClient({
  apiKey: process.env.ANCHOR_API_KEY,
});

// First create a session
const session = await anchorClient.sessions.create();
const cdpUrl = session.data.cdp_url;
const sessionId = session.data.id;

// Connect Puppeteer to the Anchor CDP session
const browser = await puppeteer.connect({
  browserWSEndpoint: cdpUrl,
  defaultViewport: null,
});

// Open a page and navigate
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto('https://example.com');
console.log('Page title:', await page.title());

// Disconnect Puppeteer (doesn't close the Anchor session)
await browser.disconnect();

// Close the session via SDK
await anchorClient.sessions.delete(sessionId);
```

This gives you all of Puppeteer's power while eliminating infrastructure complexity and adding enterprise features.

### Use Cases
