<Steps>
<Step title="Fetch API Key">
In [Anchor UI](https://app.anchorbrowser.io/api-key), copy your API key
</Step>
<Step title="Install playwright">

<CodeGroup>

```bash node.js
npm i playwright-core
```

```bash python
pip3 install playwright
```

</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Run sample code">

If you don't have access to code running, consider using the [live playground](https://app.anchorbrowser.io/playground)

The following example demonstrates how to start the browser

<CodeGroup>

```tsx node.js
import { chromium } from "playwright-core";

const browserSession = await chromium.connectOverCDP(`wss://connect.anchorbrowser.io?apiKey=ANCHOR-API-KEY`);
// Perform actions with `browser` as needed

```

```python python

from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.connect_over_cdp("wss://connect.anchorbrowser.io?apiKey=ANCHOR-API-KEY")
    # Perform actions with `browser` as needed

    browser.close()

```

</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Alter the browser configuration">

Anchor Browser supports different configurations of the browser session, such as [network configuration](/advanced/proxy), [identity profiles](/essentials/authentication-and-identity), [termination](/advanced/browser-termination) and more.

To use a browser with a sepecific configuration, first create a browser session with the desired configuration, then connect to the session using the session URL.

<CodeGroup>

```tsx node.js
import { chromium } from "playwright-core";

const response = await fetch("https://api.anchorbrowser.io/api/sessions", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "anchor-api-key": ANCHOR_API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(browserConfiguration),
});

const json = await response.json();
const { id } = json;

const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(`wss://connect.anchorbrowser.io?apiKey=${ANCHOR_API_KEY}&SessionId=${id}`);

```

```python python
import requests
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.anchorbrowser.io/api/sessions",
    headers={
        "anchor-api-key": ANCHOR_API_KEY,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    json=browser_configuration
)
response.raise_for_status()
session_id = response.json()["id"]

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.connect_over_cdp(
        f"wss://connect.anchorbrowser.io?apiKey={ANCHOR_API_KEY}&SessionId={session_id}"
    )
    # Work with browser here
    browser.close()
```

</CodeGroup>
