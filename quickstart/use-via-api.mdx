### Method 1 - Single Step Browser Tool Call (API Call)

The easiest way to utilze Anchor Browser is through browser tools. Browser tools are API endpoints that wrap end-to-end browser functionality in a single API call.

Use the [interactive tools API](/tools-api-reference/ai-tools/ask-webpage), which can easily integrate to no-code automation platforms like n8n, Zapier, Make and more.

### Method 2 - Multi-Step Browser flow & Browser Configuration

For use cases where a custom browser configuration is required, or a multi-step browser flow is needed, perform the following steps:

<Steps>
