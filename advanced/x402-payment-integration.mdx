title: X402 Payment Integration
description: Pay for sessions with X402 Protocol

---

Anchor Browser supports X402 cryptocurrency payments for browser sessions when you have insufficient credits. This allows you to pay for sessions using cryptocurrency wallets.

## How It Works

1. **Attempt Session Creation**: Try to create a browser session
2. **Credit Check**: System checks if you have sufficient credits
3. **Payment Prompt**: If Error 402 is returned, you're prompted to connect a wallet
4. **Automatic Payment**: Payment is processed automatically through your wallet
5. **Session Creation**: Session is created immediately after successful payment

## Using X402 Payments via API

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Coinbase Wallet**: Currently only Coinbase Wallet is supported
2. **Get Funds**: Ensure your wallet has USDC on the Base mainnet network
3. **Set Up WalletConnect**: Configure WalletConnect for wallet connection

### API Usage Example

When you make a session creation request without sufficient credits, the system will:

1. Return a 402 (Payment Required) status
2. Include payment details in the response
3. Your client can automatically handle the payment using X402
4. Retry the request with payment headers

Here's a Python example using the x402 library:

```python
import os, json, requests
from eth_account import Account
from x402.clients.requests import x402_requests

ENDPOINT = "https://api.anchorbrowser.io/v1/sessions"
BODY = {}

key = os.getenv("PRIVATE_KEY") or exit("Set PRIVATE_KEY=0x...")
pre = requests.post(ENDPOINT, json=BODY, timeout=30)
if pre.status_code == 200:
    print(json.dumps(pre.json(), indent=2))
    exit()

price = int(pre.json()["accepts"][0]["maxAmountRequired"])

res = x402_requests(Account.from_key(key)).post(ENDPOINT, json=BODY, timeout=60)
print(json.dumps(res.json(), indent=2))
```
