### Visual CAPTCHA solving

Anchor browser solves CAPTCHA challenges using a vision-based approach, along with extension-based fallbacks. The vision-based approach imitates human behavior to solve any CAPTCHA (including Cloudflare) without mulitple challenges.

<Note> CAPTCHA solving works best with proxy enabled. Bot detectors would likely fail CAPTCHA solving attempts that are performed without Proxy.</Note>

For the full list of available options, view the [interactive api documentation](/api-reference)

### Code Example

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.anchorbrowser.io/v1/sessions \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'anchor-api-key: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
  "browser": {
    "captcha_solver": {
      "active": true
    }
  }
}'
```
