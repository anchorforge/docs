A **Dedicated Sticky IP** ensures that a specific profile uses by default the same IP address, reserved exclusively for that profile. This is helpful when IP consistency is required across sessions.

<Steps>
<Step title="Enable sticky IP in profile creation">
Use the [Create Profile API](https://docs.anchorbrowser.io/api-reference/profiles/create-profile?playground=open) to create a profile with a dedicated sticky IP by setting:

```json
{
  "dedicated_sticky_ip": true
}
```

This allocates a dedicated IP that is not shared with other profiles. 
</Step>

<Step title="Start sessions with the reserved IP">
Any browser session started using this profile will automatically use the reserved sticky IP.
</Step>

<Step title="Override the IP with a custom proxy (optional)">
To override the default sticky IP, set the `proxy` field when using the [Start Browser Session API](https://docs.anchorbrowser.io/api-reference/browser-sessions/start-browser-session).
</Step>
