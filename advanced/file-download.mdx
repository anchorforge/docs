Anchor Browser supports two methods for downloading files during your browser sessions:

1. **Traditional Downloads**: Files are downloaded to the browser instance and then uploaded to S3 for retrieval
2. **P2P Downloads**: Files are captured directly in the browser using peer-to-peer technology, bypassing S3 storage

## Traditional File Downloads

The following examples demonstrate how to download a file using the traditional method and retrieve it from the browser session.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a browser session">
Use the [create session](api-reference/browser-sessions/start-browser-session) API to create a new browser session.
</Step>
<Step title="Browse and download a file">
Use the following example to perform a file download
<CodeGroup>

```tsx node.js
await page.goto("https://browser-tests-alpha.vercel.app/api/download-test");

await Promise.all([page.waitForEvent("download"), page.locator("#download").click()]); // The download has completed
```

```python python
await page.goto("https://browser-tests-alpha.vercel.app/api/download-test")

async with page.expect_download() as download_info:
    await page.locator("#download").click()

download = await download_info.value
```

</CodeGroup>  
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch the file from the browser session">
You can retrieve the downloaded file from the browser session using the [get session downloads](/api-reference/browser-sessions/list-session-downloads) API
</Step>
</Steps>

## P2P Downloads

For enhanced performance and direct file capture without S3 storage, see our [P2P Download Guide](/advanced/p2p-downloads) which provides complete implementation examples and best practices.
