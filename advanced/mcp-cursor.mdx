## Anchor Browser MCP with Cursor

Using Anchor Browser MCP with Cursor allows you to create deterministic, reliable and high-quality automations, which are automatically generated by cursor code generation. Cursor will use cloud browser instances to iteratively build the automation and provide you a final working workflow you can use

## Why use Anchor Browser MCP with Cursor

### ✅ Compared to Browser-Use (e.g perform web task)

- Create highly reliable automations that will consistently perform the same operation
- Avoid latency caused by runtime usage of language models
- Reduce LLM related costs by using LLMs only at build time
- Better for highly repeating use-cases

### ✅ Compared to Playwright MCP

- Use fully hosted and scalable browsers setup
- Easily configure authenticated and login for the saas applications you want to automate
- Get headful browser instances, which are more reliable and similar to humans
- Avoid getting blocked by bot detection mechanism
- Still keep AI in the loop for specific tasks where runtime reasoning is required

## Quick setup guide

1. Install the MCP server - Use the [Cursor setup example](https://docs.anchorbrowser.io/advanced/mcp#setup-in-cursor)
2. On your cursor console, provide a prompt describing the target task. Example would be:
3. For fully autonomous building, enable cursor to auto-run the generated code
4. Cursor agent will iteratively work on building your browser automation and will generate an output script
5. Edit the script to contain the remote browser setup, which will be the deployable version for the browser automation
