## Overview

Learn how to combine OpenAI's Computer Use Agent (CUA) with Anchor Browser to enable powerful cloud-based browser automation.

CUA is an advanced AI system that combines visual perception, contextual understanding, and browser control capabilities. When integrated with Anchor Browser's cloud infrastructure, it provides a robust platform for deploying automated web interactions at scale.

### Prerequisites

- OpenAI API key with Computer Use Agent access
- Anchorbrowser account and API key
- Python 3.8+

### Basic Integration
This basic setup will get you up and running with a CUA agent using Anchor Browser as the underlying browser automation platform.

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone the repository">
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/anchorforge/openai-cua-sample-app.git
```
</Step>
<Step title="Install the required packages">
```bash 
pip install -r "requirements.txt"
```
</Step>
<Step title="Set the environment variables">
```
ANCHOR_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
OPENAI_ORG=YOUR_OPENAI_ORG
```
</Step>
<Step title="Run the agent">
```
python cli.py --computer anchorbrowser --input "Play tic tac toe"
```
</Step>
</Steps>

### Customizing the CUA Agent
The CUA agent can be customized by updating the flags in the CLI:

- `--input`: The initial input to the agent (optional: the CLI will prompt you for input if not provided)
- `--debug`: Enable debug mode.
- `--show`: Show images (screenshots) during the execution.
- `--start-url`: Start the browsing session with a specific URL. By default, the CLI will start the browsing session with https://bing.com.
