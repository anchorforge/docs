  `On the current stargazers list, return the GitHub profile URLs of all users
  that are a part of a well-known company. Then, do this for the first 3 pages
  using the "page" query parameter.
  Return a JSON array result: ["url1", "url2", ...].`,
  {
    taskOptions: {
      url: 'https://github.com/apache/airflow/stargazers?page=1',
    }
  }
)
console.log(result);
```
```python python
result = anchor_client.agent.task(
  '''On the current stargazers list, return the GitHub profile URLs of all users
  that are a part of a well-known company. Then, do this for the first 3 pages
  using the "page" query parameter.
