The following example shows form filling, including the ability to self-complete missing data in the form filling process.

```tsx node.js
import { chromium } from 'playwright';

const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(connectionString); // Fill in the browser CDP string
const context = browser.contexts()[0];
const ai = context.serviceWorkers()[0];
const page = context.pages()[0];

const form_url = "https://formspree.io/library/donation/charity-donation-form/preview.html"
await page.goto(form_url);

const task = 'Fill out the form as if you were Micheal Scott'
const result = await ai.evaluate(task)

console.log(result);
```
