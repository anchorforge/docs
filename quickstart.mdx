<Steps>
<Step title="Fetch API Key">
In [Anchor UI](https://app.anchorbrowser.io/api-key), copy your API key
</Step>

<Step title="Choose how to control your browser">
Anchor Browser can be accessed in multiple ways. Choose one, or proceed with the code-based quickstart:

- Directly in code (proceed with next steps)
- As a tool in agent frameworks:
  - CrewAI
  - Langchain
  - Custom agent framework
- Build tools in [Anchor Playground](https://app.anchorbrowser.io/playground) and use them via API requests

<Warning>Only proceed to steps 3 and 4 if you plan to control your browser through code</Warning>

</Step>
<Step title="Install playwright">

<CodeGroup>

```bash node.js
npm i playwright-core
```

```bash python
pip3 install playwright
```

</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Run sample code">

If you don't have access to code running, consider using the [live playground](https://app.anchorbrowser.io/playground)

The following example demonstrates how to start the browser

<CodeGroup>

```tsx node.js
import { chromium } from "playwright-core";

const browserSession = await chromium.connectOverCDP(`wss://connect.anchorbrowser.io?api-key=ANCHOR-API-KEY`);
// Perform actions with `browser` as needed

```

```python python

from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.connect_over_cdp("wss://connect.anchorbrowser.io?api-key=ANCHOR-API-KEY")
    # Perform actions with `browser` as needed

    browser.close()

```

</CodeGroup>
