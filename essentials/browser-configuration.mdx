### Browser configuration object

The browser is controlled via the **Browser configuration object**, a json object with the following format:

```json
{ 
  "adblock_config": { "active":true }, // Default: True
  "captcha_config": { "active":true }, // Default: True
  "proxy_config": 
    {
        "active": true, // Default: False
        "type" : "anchor-resedential" // Optional, will default to anchor resedential
        "country": "COUNTRY_CODE" // Optional, default empty
    }
}
```

Example utilization of browser configuration in code:

<CodeGroup>
```tsx node.js
{ "extensions": [“adblock”, “captcha”], "proxy": {“country”: “COUNTRY_CODE”} 
  "adblock_config":
  {"enabled":"true"}
}
```

```python python
pip3 install playwright
```
</CodeGroup>

### Proxy Configuration

`type` - Proxy type, currently only `anchor-resedential` supported
`country` - Optional country code parameter, if left empty defaults to best available proxy. Full list of possible country codes:
