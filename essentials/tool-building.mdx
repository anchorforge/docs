Anchor Browser allows you to build and customize tools to automate specific workflows and browser interactions efficiently. The tool-building feature provides a streamlined way to define reusable tools that interact with web pages in an automated fashion, including navigating pages, filling out forms, handling CAPTCHAs, and managing other advanced interactions.

### Overview

- **Customizable Workflow Tools**: Design tools that automate multi-step workflows. These tools can be reused by AI agents to perform complex tasks in a consistent and efficient manner.
- **Integration with AI Agents**: The tools you build can be seamlessly integrated into AI agent frameworks like Langchain, CrewAI, or your own custom frameworks, making it easy to scale web interactions.
- **Consumed via API**: Once the tools are built, they can be consumed via a simple API. This allows your AI agents to leverage these tools to perform specific tasks efficiently without manual intervention.
- **Secure Environment**: All tools are executed in secure, isolated browser sessions, ensuring that sensitive information such as cookies and credentials remains protected.
  
Tool building in Anchor Browser is designed to reduce repetitive code, allow for easy reuse of complex interactions, and accelerate the automation of web-based processes for your AI agents.
