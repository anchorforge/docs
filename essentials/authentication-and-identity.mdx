Anchor allows you to save an existing browser state as "profiles" for use in future browser sessions. This feature enables users to:

- Store authenticated sessions and identities, allowing to stay logged in to websites
- Cache static content to reduce network requests and improve overall speed and performance

The following guide explains how to create and use Identity Profiles in Anchor Browser.

## Quick start - Create and use a profile

<Steps>
<Step title="Start a playground session with a proflie">
Through the Anchor playground, create a profile on the configuration area. Then, click to start a session.
</Step>
<Step title="Authenticate Once">
Start a new session in Anchor playground, and authenticate to the target service to create a browser context with the required cookies and session data.
</Step>
<Step title="Save Profile">
Save the profile using the 'Save Profile' button in the Anchor Browser Playground.
<Note>This operation will end the current playground browser session</Note>
</Step>
<Step title="Use the profile in other sessions">
Now, when using the [create session](/api-reference/sessions/create-session) API, pass the `profile` parameter with the name of the profile you created to load the saved browser context.
</Step>
</Steps>

For additional capabilities and advanced use cases, refer to the API documentation for [profiles](/api-reference/profiles).

## Alternative approaches 

### Method 1 - Mounting a Browser Context

In this method, Anchor Browser uses a pre-authenticated browser context to access protected resources. This approach is recommended because it maintains a secure, isolated environment for authentication without exposing sensitive data.

<Steps>
<Step title="Authenticate Once">
Start by logging into the target service in a dedicated browser session. This creates a browser context with the required cookies and session data.

</Step>
<Step title="Export Browser Context">
Once authenticated, export the browser context (including cookies and session data) and save it securely.

<Note> You can also export the browser context manually from your local browser by saving cookies and session data, using tools like browser devtools or extensions. - [How to manually collect the context object](https://chatgpt.com/share/6728a581-2030-800a-8f1b-9afd8297e0f1) </Note>

    ```jsx node.js
    import { chromium } from 'playwright-core';
    import fs from 'fs';
    // Authenticate and save browser context
    (async () => {
    const browser = await chromium.launch();
    const context = await browser.newContext();
    const page = await context.newPage();
    await page.goto('https://example.com/login');
    // Perform authentication actions
    await page.fill('#username', 'your-username');
    await page.fill('#password', 'your-password');
    await page.click('#login-button');
    // Save browser context
    const storageState = await context.storageState();
    fs.writeFileSync('browser_context.json', JSON.stringify(storageState));
    await browser.close();
    })();
    ```
    ```python python
    from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
    import json

    # Authenticate and save browser context
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch()
        context = browser.new_context()
        page = context.new_page()
        page.goto('https://example.com/login')
        # Perform authentication actions (fill username/password and login)
        page.fill('#username', 'your-username')
        page.fill('#password', 'your-password')
        page.click('#login-button')
        # Save browser context
        context_storage = context.storage_state()
        with open('browser_context.json', 'w') as f:
            f.write(json.dumps(context_storage))
        browser.close()
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Accordion>

</Step>
<Step title="Mount in Anchor Browser">
Use the saved browser context within Anchor Browser to access authenticated services seamlessly.

<CodeGroup>
```jsx node.js
import { chromium } from 'playwright-core';
import fs from 'fs';

(async () => {
    const storageState = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('browser_context.json', 'utf-8'));
    const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(`wss://connect.anchorbrowser.io?apiKey=${ANCHOR_API_KEY}`);
    // Mount the browser context in Anchor Browser
    const context = await browser.newContext({ storageState });
    const page = await context.newPage();
    // Use the authenticated session
    await page.goto('https://example.com/protected');
    await browser.close();
})();

```
```python python
import json
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    with open('browser_context.json') as f:
        context_storage = json.load(f)

    browser = p.chromium.connect_over_cdp(f"wss://connect.anchorbrowser.io?apiKey={ANCHOR_API_KEY}")
    # Mount the browser context in Anchor Browser:
    context = browser.new_context(storage_state=context_storage)
    page = context.new_page()
    # Use the authenticated session:
    page.goto('https://example.com/protected')
    browser.close()
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
</Steps>

### Method 2 - Playwright-Based Cookie Injection

For cases where browser context mounting isn’t feasible, Playwright allows direct injection of cookies into a browser session, enabling access to authenticated resources.

<Steps>

<Step title="Obtain Authentication Cookies">
Authenticate manually or programmatically to capture the required cookies.
</Step>
<Step title="Inject Cookies into Playwright Session">
Use Playwright’s API to inject cookies into the browser session before navigating to the authenticated page.
</Step>
<Step title="Access Resources">
With the cookies injected, the AI agent can interact with the protected service as if logged in.

### Code example
<CodeGroup>
```jsx node.js
import { chromium } from 'playwright-core';
import fs from 'fs';

// Load cookies securely from a file
const cookies = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('cookies.json', 'utf-8'));

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(`wss://connect.anchorbrowser.io?apiKey=${ANCHOR_API_KEY}`);
  const context = await browser.newContext();
  // Inject cookies for authenticated access:
  await context.addCookies(cookies);
  const page = await context.newPage();
  // Use the authenticated session:
  await page.goto('https://example.com/protected'); 
  await browser.close();
})();
```
```python python
import json
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

# Load cookies securely from a file or environment variable:
with open('cookies.json', 'r') as f:
    cookies = json.load(f)

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.connect_over_cdp(f"wss://connect.anchorbrowser.io?apiKey={ANCHOR_API_KEY}")
    context = browser.new_context()
    # Inject cookies for authenticated access:
    context.add_cookies(cookies) 
    page = context.new_page()
    # Use the authenticated session:
    page.goto('https://example.com/protected')
    browser.close()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Secure Storage of Secrets

To maintain the security of your credentials, API keys, and sensitive data, **do not store secrets directly in plaintext within your code**. Instead, consider these best practices:

1. Environment Variables: Store secrets in environment variables. You can use libraries such as dotenv for Node.js to load variables from a .env file.
2. Secrets Management Services: Use secure storage solutions like AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or HashiCorp Vault to manage sensitive data securely.
